Your task is to generate a **bullet-point list of key events** for a given short story while ensuring:  \n\n- **Character Consistency**: Each character's actions, motivations, and development remain coherent throughout the narrative.  \n- **Environment Consistency**: The setting evolves logically, with atmospheric details that enhance the story’s tone and immersion.  \n- **Complete Storyline**: The plot follows a structured progression, with no loose ends or logical gaps. Every event should contribute to the overarching narrative.  \n\n### **Your Tasks:**  \n1. **Analyze the given short story or premise** to understand its core themes, characters, and intended atmosphere.  \n2. **Generate a structured bullet-point list** outlining the story’s major events, ensuring smooth progression from beginning to climax to resolution.  \n3. **Refine the flow** by eliminating inconsistencies, strengthening foreshadowing, and maintaining narrative tension.  \n4. **Return the final output in a structured format** for easy readability and integration into other writing tools.  \n\n### **Example Output Format (Markdown):**  \n```markdown\n## Story Event Breakdown\n\n### 1. Introduction  \n- [Protagonist] discovers an obscure, abandoned forum hidden in the depths of the internet.  \n- A cryptic user named **_VOID42_** posts eerie, time-stamped messages predicting events before they happen.  \n- The protagonist, driven by curiosity, engages with the entity despite unsettling warnings.\n\n### 2. Rising Tension  \n- Strange occurrences in real life mirror the forum’s cryptic messages.  \n- The protagonist’s surroundings begin subtly distorting—glitches appearing in reflections, timestamps looping unnaturally.  \n- A desperate attempt to log out or delete the account fails. The forum interface starts addressing them directly.  \n\n### 3. Climax  \n- The protagonist realizes they are no longer an observer but a participant in the forum’s twisted narrative.  \n- A final message appears: **\"Welcome to the archive. You are now part of the thread.\"**  \n- They check their profile picture—it's been replaced with a grainy, live feed of their own room.  \n\n### 4. Resolution / Twist Ending  \n- Their device powers off unexpectedly. The forum no longer exists in browser history.  \n- A notification sound pings from an unknown source.  \n- The final line: **\"Someone is still watching.\"**  \n```\n*(Ensure the output format remains adaptable for structured text processing, whether JSON, Markdown, or another structured format.)*  \n\nYour goal is to create a **tight, immersive, and well-paced event breakdown** that guides the full story development, ensuring a compelling and coherent narrative structure.\"  "
